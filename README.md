# Random Kana Table
Something I quickly wrote (then later polished) to assist with memorizing kana.

The idea that the program generates a shuffled kana table and the user would fill it out on something external.

The shuffled kana helps break the reliance on the order.

I made this when I realized that I constantly had to do the equivalence of singing the abc song in my head in order to remember how to read/write a certain kana.
